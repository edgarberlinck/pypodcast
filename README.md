# pypodcast

Once upon a time, I decided to create a fully automated podcast, and I did it! You can check out here: https://open.spotify.com/show/0GN5WBnLxmLBYslhb9IaQq.

Yeah, I only published at Spotify.

I've created all the components using Node.js. The source code is private because:

- It's just a Proof of concept and the code is a complete mess.
- I committed a lot of private keys (shame on me), and I don't want to change it just to open the code.
- There is a lot of overengineering. It could be more simple.
- I have a love affair with Javascript and Node, that are my main languages, but I always want to do something BIG using Python, so I decided to create a second automated podcast, this time in English (Tech Bot is in Portuguese).

I'm inviting you to watch the results.
